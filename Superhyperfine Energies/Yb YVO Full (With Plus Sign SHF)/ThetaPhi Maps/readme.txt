- Transition Overlap Maps is not very useful because they are made using a a fixed displacement vector but the maximum overlap is distance-dependent. Hence we switched to computing only the amplitude at the real atom's positions.

- Branching Ratio_Contrast_rho maps are probably correct in principle but they are made without the S_x matrix in the amplitude.
