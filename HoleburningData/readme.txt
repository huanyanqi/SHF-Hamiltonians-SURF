ybyvo_burnscan_B=1T_1.65K
-------------------------
- 1 T along c
- Polarisation along c
- Sweeping laser (convolution)
- Middle line is zero spin (Yb-170)
- There is no HF since there is no nuclear spin, the transition is from the lower Zeeman branch to the upper Zeeman branch
- For Yb-171 there are 2 transitions at detuning 58 and 62 GHz which correspond to the side big holes, the centre one 
is the 60 GHz detuning transition for Yb-170 (no nuclear spin).

ybyvo_bbpit0MHz_hbw_burn2_nice
-------------------------------
- ~680 mT || c and ~240 mT \perp c (?) ==> B = 721 mT, theta = 0.33929
- Transition is from the lower Zeeman branch to the lower Zeeman branch, and within it from the lower HF to the lower HF and also
from the higher HF to the higher HF.

- Fixed values: 0.661 mT instead. E is along x direction.

ybyvo_bbpit0MHz_onres2_burn2_nice
--------------------------------
- 160 mT || c (?)

For above two plots:
- 3rd highest set of optical transitions
- Referencing zero field transition as 304505 GHz, this line is 304521 GHz (16 GHz above)
- Accessing all SHF lines but not necessarily all HF lines
- Polarisation is such that the middle lines are stronger
